Objective: To build a smart winter jacket with a lithium battery and 320 cm of heating wire.

ai:::completed watts Imagine an adult person who is wearing a normal jacket in a -10-celsius  winter. To make them feel warm, how many watts of energy should we add, so to speak, inside the jacket? This is the heat that is generated by this device.

ai:::ignore
- an adult at rest in extremely cold conditions (-10°C) loses about 100–150 watts of heat.
- 30 – 50% efficiency -> 200-350 watts

ai:::completed current If we use a battery-capacity::: li-ion battery, connected in series, what is the nominal current that is drawn from the battery?

ai:::ignore
- 5C x 5000 mAh -> each cell can supply 25 A
- 200 W == 18 A
ai:::ignore

ai:::completed operation-time For how long can we keep this device on?

ai:::ignore
- at 200 W: ~ 1 hour
ai:::ignore

ai:::complete resistance What is the range of resistance per meter for heating wires?

ai:::ignore
common alloys:
- Nichrome: ~1.0 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m
	- diameter of 0.5 mm ~= 5.1 Ω
	- 5–10 Ω/m, for diameter=0.5 mm
- Kanthal: ~1.5 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m.
	- ~6–12 Ω/m, for diameter=0.5 mm
- Carbon fiber: ~1.0 × 10⁻⁵ Ω·m
