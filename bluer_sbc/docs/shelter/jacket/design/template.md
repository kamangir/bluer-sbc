Objective: To build a smart winter jacket with a lithium battery and 320 cm of heating wire.

ai:::completed watts Imagine an adult person who is wearing a normal jacket in a -10-celsius  winter. To make them feel warm, how many watts of energy should we add, so to speak, inside the jacket? This is the heat that is generated by this device.

ai:::ignore
- an adult at rest in extremely cold conditions (-10°C) loses about 100–150 watts of heat.
- 30 – 50% efficiency -> 200-350 watts

ai:::complete current If we use a battery-capacity::: li-ion battery, what is the nominal current that is drawn from the battery?

ai:::complete operation-time For how long can we keep this device on?

ai:::complete resistance What is the range of resistance per meter for heating wires?
