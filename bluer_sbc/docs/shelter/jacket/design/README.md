# shelter: jacket: design



Objective: To build a smart winter jacket with a lithium battery and 320 cm of heating wire.

> Imagine an adult person who is wearing a normal jacket in a -10-celsius  winter. To make them feel warm, how many watts of energy should we add, so to speak, inside the jacket? This is the heat that is generated by this device.

To calculate the energy needed to warm a person from -10°C to body temperature (around 36°C), we'll use the formula for heat transfer: **Q = m * c * ΔT** Where: - **m** = mass of the person (assume 70 kg for an average adult) - **c** = specific heat capacity of the human body (~3500 J/kg°C) - **ΔT** = temperature change (36°C - (-10°C) = 46°C) **Q = 70 kg * 3500 J/kg°C * 46°C = 11,270,000 J (joules)** This is the energy required to raise the person's body temperature by 46°C. However, this is a one-time calculation. Since heating is continuous, we need to convert this to **power (watts)** by dividing by time (in seconds): **P = Q / t** Assume a reasonable time frame of **1 hour (3600 seconds)** to reach the desired temperature: **P = 11,270,000 J / 3600 s ≈ 3130 W (watts)** So, you'd need approximately **3130 watts** of continuous heating power to warm a 70 kg person from -10°C to body temperature in one hour. This is a simplified calculation and doesn't account for: 1. **Thermal losses** (the body will constantly lose heat to the environment) 2. **Activity level** (a person moving around will generate their own heat) 3. **Insulation** (how well the jacket retains heat) **Practical Considerations:** - A 3130 W heater is extremely powerful and would require a large battery (e.g., a 3000 W lithium battery would barely suffice for a few minutes) - Real-world applications would likely use **lower wattages** (e.g., 100-300 W) with dynamic control systems to maintain warmth without overworking the battery - You'll need to balance the heating power with battery capacity and thermal management to ensure safe operation

> What is the nominal current that is drawn from the battery?

To determine the **resistance per meter** of the heating wire, you’ll need to know two things: 1. **The resistivity (ρ)** of the material the wire is made from (e.g., nichrome, carbon, or copper). 2. **The cross-sectional area (A)** of the wire. ### Formula: **Resistance per meter (R/m) = Resistivity (ρ) / Cross-sectional Area (A)** ### Example Calculation: Assume you’re using **nichrome wire** (common for heating elements), which has a resistivity of approximately **ρ ≈ 1.1 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m** (Ohm-meters). If the wire has a **cross-sectional area of 0.5 mm²** (0.5 × 10⁻⁶ m²), then: **R/m = (1.1 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m) / (0.5 × 10⁻⁶ m²) = 2.2 Ω/m** ### Key Notes: - **Resistivity (ρ)** depends on the material. For example: - Nichrome: ~1.1 × 10⁻⁶ Ω·m - Carbon: ~3.5 × 10⁻⁵ Ω·m - Copper: ~1.7 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m (very low, not ideal for heating) - **Cross-sectional area** is determined by the wire’s diameter. A thicker wire (larger A) has lower resistance per meter. - If you provide the wire’s material and diameter, I can calculate the exact resistance per meter for your design. Let me know the wire’s material and dimensions, and I’ll compute the resistance per meter for you!

> If we use a battery-capacity::: li-ion battery, for how long can we keep this device on?

To determine how long your lithium-ion battery can power the jacket, we need to know the **battery's capacity** (in amp-hours, Ah) and the **current draw** from the jacket. ### Formula: **Battery Life (in hours) = Battery Capacity (Ah) / Current Draw (A)** ### Example: If your battery has a capacity of **20 Ah** and the jacket draws **846 A** (from our earlier calculation), the battery life would be: **20 Ah / 846 A ≈ 0.0236 hours** (~1.4 minutes). This is **extremely short** and impractical. ### Key Factors to Clarify: 1. **Battery Capacity**: What is the battery's total capacity? For example: - A typical smartphone battery might be 3,000 mAh (3 Ah). - A larger pack for industrial use could be 100 Ah or more. 2. **Voltage**: What is the battery's nominal voltage? (e.g., 3.7V, 12V, 24V) - This affects current draw and power output. 3. **Power Management**: Are you using a power inverter, DC-to-DC converter, or smart controller to regulate the load? ### Real-World Insight: - **Realistic Battery Lifetimes**: Most wearable heating systems use **100-300 W** of power, not 3,000 W. - **Battery Sizing**: A 100 W heater running for 10 hours would require a **100 Wh (100 watt-hour)** battery. - **Lithium Battery Efficiency**: Lithium-ion batteries are typically **85-95% efficient**, so account for losses in your design. If you share the battery's capacity and voltage, I can calculate the exact runtime for your design.
