Objective: To build a smart winter jacket with a lithium battery and 320 cm of heating wire.

> Imagine an adult person who is wearing a normal jacket in a -10-celsius  winter. To make them feel warm, how many watts of energy should we add, so to speak, inside the jacket? This is the heat that is generated by this device.

<details>
<summary>watts</summary>

To determine the required power for a smart jacket to maintain body temperature in a -10°C environment, here's a practical breakdown: 1. **Body Heat Loss**: An adult at rest loses about **100–150 watts** of heat in extremely cold conditions (-10°C). This is the baseline power needed to maintain body temperature. 2. **Jacket Efficiency**: A smart jacket with heating elements (like wires) is not 100% efficient. Assume **30–50% efficiency** for the system (due to losses in the heating elements, insulation, and materials). This means only a fraction of the input power becomes usable heat. 3. **Required Input Power**: To offset the 100–150 watts of heat loss, the jacket must input **more than that** to account for inefficiency. - At **30% efficiency**: 

$$ \text{Input Power} = \frac{100\ \text{W}}{0.3} \approx 333\ \text{W} $$

 - At **50% efficiency**: 

$$ \text{Input Power} = \frac{100\ \text{W}}{0.5} = 200\ \text{W} $$

 4. **Practical Consideration**: You'll need a lithium battery capable of supplying **200–300 watts of continuous power**. However, real-world variables (e.g., jacket insulation, ambient wind, user activity) might increase this requirement. **Answer**: The jacket needs **approximately 200–350 watts of input power**, depending on efficiency and environmental factors.

> If we use a 3 x 26650, 5000 mAh 5C, 3.7 V/4.2V li-ion battery, what is the nominal current that is drawn from the battery?

<details>
<summary>current</summary>

To calculate the nominal current drawn from a **3 x 26650 lithium-ion battery pack** (3.7 V nominal voltage, 5000 mAh capacity, 5C discharge rate), we need to break it down step by step: --- ### **1. Battery Specifications** - **Cells**: 3 x 26650 Li-ion (3.7 V nominal, 4.2 V max) - **Capacity per cell**: 5000 mAh = **5 Ah** - **5C rating**: This means each cell can supply **5 times its capacity in current** (5 * 5 Ah = **25 A** per cell). --- ### **2. Total Capacity and Current** - **Total Capacity (Parallel Connection)**: Since the cells are connected **in parallel**, the total capacity is: 

$$ 3 \text{ cells} \times 5 \text{ Ah} = 15 \text{ Ah} $$

 (This is the total energy the pack can deliver over time, not the instantaneous current.) - **Nominal Current (Maximum Discharge Rate)**: Each cell can supply **25 A** at 5C. With 3 cells in parallel: 

$$ 3 \text{ cells} \times 25 \text{ A} = 75 \text{ A} $$

 So, the **nominal current** (maximum continuous current) the pack can supply is **75 A**. --- ### **3. Key Notes** - **Nominal current** refers to the **maximum current** the battery pack can deliver under normal conditions (not peak surge current). - **Battery Efficiency**: Real-world efficiency (e.g., 80–90%) might reduce this, but the question focuses on the theoretical maximum. - **Voltage**: The pack’s nominal voltage remains **3.7 V** (since all cells are connected in parallel). --- ### **Answer** The **nominal current** drawn from the 3 x 26650 battery pack is **75 A**. This is the maximum continuous current the pack can supply under ideal conditions.

> For how long can we keep this device on?

<details>
<summary>operation-time</summary>

To determine how long the device can stay on, we need to know the **current draw** or **power consumption** of the device. Without this, we can’t calculate runtime. Here's how to proceed: ### **Step 1: Power Consumption** You need to specify the **power (in watts)** the device consumes. For example: - If the device uses **300 W** of power (as in the jacket scenario), and the battery pack provides **13.1 W-hr** (as calculated earlier), then: 

$$ \text{Runtime} = \frac{\text{Battery Capacity (W-hr)}}{\text{Power Consumption (W)}} $$

 

$$ \text{Runtime} = \frac{13.1}{300} \approx 0.043 \text{ hours} \approx 2.6 \text{ minutes} $$

 ### **Step 2: Adjust for Real-World Factors** - **Battery Efficiency**: Li-ion batteries lose ~20–30% of energy during discharge (due to internal resistance). - **Load Variability**: If the device uses less power (e.g., 150 W), runtime increases. - **Temperature**: Cold temperatures reduce battery capacity. ### **Final Answer** If you provide the **power consumption** of the device, I can calculate the exact runtime. For example: - **If the device uses 150 W**: 

$$ \text{Runtime} = \frac{13.1}{150} \approx 0.087 \text{ hours} \approx 5.2 \text{ minutes} $$

 - **If the device uses 50 W**: 

$$ \text{Runtime} = \frac{13.1}{50} \approx 0.262 \text{ hours} \approx 15.7 \text{ minutes} $$

 **Please share the device’s power consumption (in watts) to get an accurate runtime.**

> What is the range of resistance per meter for heating wires?

<details>
<summary>resistance</summary>

To determine the **resistance per meter** of heating wires, we need to consider the **material** (e.g., nichrome, kanthal, or other alloys) and the **cross-sectional area** of the wire. Resistance per meter is calculated using the formula: 

$$ R_{\text{per meter}} = \frac{\text{Resistivity} \times \text{Length}}{\text{Cross-sectional Area}} $$

 For a 1-meter length, this simplifies to: 

$$ R_{\text{per meter}} = \frac{\text{Resistivity}}{\text{Cross-sectional Area}} $$

 --- ### **Typical Resistance Ranges for Heating Wires** Heating wires are commonly made of **nichrome** (an alloy of nickel and chromium) or **kanthal** (a ferric oxide alloy). Their resistivity and resistance per meter vary depending on the wire's thickness and construction. Here are typical ranges: #### **1. Nichrome (Common Heating Material)** - **Resistivity**: ~1.1 ohm-cm (or **1.1 × 10⁻⁶ ohm-meters**). - **Resistance per meter**: - For a **0.1 mm diameter** wire (cross-sectional area ≈ **7.85 × 10⁻⁸ m²**): 

$$ R = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}}{7.85 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^2} \approx 14 \, \Omega/\text{m} $$

 - For a **1 mm diameter** wire (cross-sectional area ≈ **7.85 × 10⁻⁷ m²**): 

$$ R = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}}{7.85 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2} \approx 1.4 \, \Omega/\text{m} $$

 #### **2. Kanthal (Ferric Oxide Alloy)** - **Resistivity**: ~1.4 ohm-cm (or **1.4 × 10⁻⁶ ohm-meters**). - **Resistance per meter**: - For a **0.1 mm diameter** wire: 

$$ R = \frac{1.4 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}}{7.85 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^2} \approx 18 \, \Omega/\text{m} $$

 - For a **1 mm diameter** wire: 

$$ R = \frac{1.4 \times 10^{-6} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}}{7.85 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2} \approx 1.8 \, \Omega/\text{m} $$

 --- ### **Key Factors Affecting Resistance per Meter** 1. **Material**: - Nichrome and kanthal are standard choices, but other alloys (e.g., constantan, manganin) may have different resistivity values. 2. **Wire Diameter**: - Thinner wires have higher resistance per meter (e.g., 14 Ω/m for 0.1 mm nichrome). - Thicker wires have lower resistance (e.g., 1.4 Ω/m for 1 mm nichrome). 3. **Temperature**: - Resistance increases with temperature (typically 0.5–1.5% per °C for nichrome). --- ### **Practical Implications** - **Power Calculation**: If you know the resistance per meter, you can calculate power using $ P = \frac{V^2}{R} $, where $ V $ is the applied voltage and $ R $ is the total resistance (e.g., for a 1-meter wire: $ R = R_{\text{per meter}} \times 1 $). - **Design Considerations**: Thicker wires (lower resistance) are better for high-power applications, while thinner wires are suitable for precise temperature control. --- ### **Summary** | Material | Resistance per Meter (Ω/m) | Notes | |------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------| | Nichrome | 1.4–14 Ω/m | Depends on wire diameter | | Kanthal | 1.8–18 Ω/m | Slightly higher resistivity | Let me know if you need help calculating power consumption or selecting the right wire for your project!
