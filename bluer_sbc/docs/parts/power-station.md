# parts: power-station

 - capacity: ~ 500 Wh usable: 200 W × 2 h = 400 Wh; allow ~25 % overhead for losses → ~500 Wh
 - continuous AC output ≥ 250–300 W = 200 W load + buffer for inefficiencies / other small loads.
 - peak / surge output ≥ 500–600 W, to handle inrush/startup power surges.

- power station.
